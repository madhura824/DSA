Print Pattern

Print a sequence of numbers starting with N, without using loop, where replace N with N - 5, until N > 0. After that replace N with N + 5 until N regains its initial value.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 16
Output: 
16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
Explaination: 
The value decreases until it is greater than 0. After that it increases and stops when it becomes 16 again.
